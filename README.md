Features an optional MVC implementation, reactive state machines, modular services, parallel global eventstreams, serializer interface, double precision Vector2/3/Quaternion/Math, and many other things that makes your life easier.

Needs Unity with .NET 4.6 support enabled. (found in PlayerSettings)
